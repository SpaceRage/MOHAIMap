The modern Duwamish descend from at least two separate groups: the Duwamish, and the Hachuamish, being the largest. Traditionally, the Duwuamish spoke a subdialect of the southern dialect of Lushootseed, which is a Salishan dialect continuum that is spoken throught the Puget Sound region of Washington. Duwamish people today are enrolled in several different tribes, including(but not limited to) the federally- recognized Muckleshoot Indian Tribe and Suquamish Tribe, and the epynomous Duwamish Tribe, which has not received federal recognition."

Their ancestral lands encompass the scenic Skagit River and the breathtaking Cascade Mountains, which have played a crucial role in shaping their culture and way of life. The Upper Skagit Tribe possesses a deep connection to the land, relying on the river's salmon runs, the forests' resources, and the mountains' protection. Throughout their history, they have weathered challenges brought by European settlement and the subsequent impacts on their sovereignty and cultural practices. Despite these adversities, the Upper Skagit Tribe has persevered, working diligently to reclaim and revitalize their ancestral language, traditions, and ceremonies. Today, they continue to honor their heritage, promote cultural preservation, engage in environmental stewardship, and foster community development, ensuring a vibrant future for their people while maintaining a profound connection to their ancestral lands."

They moved from village to village in their traditional territory during the spring, summer and fall, for fishing and resource gathering, and settled into more permanent longhouses for the winter months. The inhabitants hunted game and subsisted on the wealth of shellfish, herring, and salmon. They were craftspeople skilled in woodcarving and basket making, and they fashioned ceremonial masks, serving dishes and utensils, and storage boxes from cedar, and woven mats, rope, and clothing from cedar bark."

The tribe’s first recorded direct contact with European culture came in 1792 and resulted in a devastating smallpox epidemic that took the lives of many. There were nine Twana communities, the largest being known as the Skokomish, or “big river people.” The Twana subsisted on hunting, fishing and gathering activities, practicing a nomadic life-style during warmer weather and resettling at permanent sites during the winter. Twana descendants live on the Skokomish Reservation, and all have become known as the Skokomish Tribe."
